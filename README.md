After the model is saved, it will be loaded into the predictor file. The input that is entered from the GUI will be processed and the result will be shown in the result button. 
You can try another model such as FuzzyGA, ANFIS-GA and another algorithm to suit your dataset. 

# Future Works
1)Save the key GUI data for user reference using the save button in the GUI
2)If the user is most likely or has a high possibility of heart disease, the report button will be utilised for the referral to an appointment with the doctor for early treatment.
